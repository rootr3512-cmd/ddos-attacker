## Step 1: Install `requests`

Open **PowerShell** (Windows) or **Terminal** (Mac/Linux) and run:

-powershell
____________________
pip install requests

This will download and install the requests library, which the script needs to work.
You only need to run this once.

Step 2: Navigate to the script folder and run
Open PowerShell (Windows) or Terminal (Mac/Linux).

Go to the folder where ddos.pyw is located. For example, if it is on your Desktop:

-powershell
______________________________________________
-cd C:\Users\YourName\Desktop\YourProjectFolder
______________________________________________
Replace YourName and YourProjectFolder with your actual username and folder name.

Once you are in the folder, run the script:

-powershell
________________
-python ddos.pyw
________________
You should see the script start and send requests to your local test server.
